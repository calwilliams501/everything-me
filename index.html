					<h2>Professionally</h2>

					<p>Over the past 5 years, I have established a successful career in software development, fueled by my passion for self-study and practical experience. My expertise in Python, Kotlin, and JavaScript has enabled me to lead the development of a logistics-focused Android application, maintain mission-critical internal websites, and deliver on various projects.</p>
					<p>As a highly adaptable and driven individual, I thrive on challenges and am always seeking opportunities to learn and grow. I believe that my strong work ethic, coupled with my exceptional problem-solving skills, make me a valuable asset to any team. I am committed to delivering high-quality work that consistently exceeds expectations and drives results.</p>

					<h2>Personally</h2>

					<p>In my free time, I enjoy unwinding by playing video and board games with my friends and exploring new culinary experiences with my partner. I'm also an avid collector of vinyl records, always on the lookout for fresh and exciting music to add to my collection.</p>
					<p>But when I'm not relaxing with my hobbies, I'm constantly pursuing new knowledge and skills. Whether it's building my own PC or creating this website, I love taking on new challenges and expanding my technical abilities. My passion for learning and technology has been a driving force in my life for as long as I can remember, and I am always seeking out new ways to grow and develop my expertise.</p>

				<h2>Grange Fencing</h2>

				<p>As my first role in the software development industry, I was solely responsible for the development and maintenance of an in-house Android application, implementing location tracking in this and another Android application, crafting new features for the companyâ€™s employee portal to the required specifications, and building connections to essential data sources.</p>
				<p>In this role, I gained a deeper understanding of the importance of planning, analysis, and design, and was involved in or solely responsible for the entire software development lifecycle for several projects while at Grange Fencing.</p>
				<p>In addition to my direct software development responsibilities, I also trained users and created user guides for the software to facilitate the company's transition from a paper-based business model to a more efficient tech-focused approach. Through my work, I demonstrated my strong problem-solving skills and ability to deliver high-quality software that meets the needs of both end-users and the business.</p>

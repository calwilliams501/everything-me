						<h1>Python</h1>

						<p>My journey in Software Development began with Python. Fascinated with AI advancements, I decided to delve into the language to acquire the basics that would eventually enable me to land an apprenticeship as a Software Developer.</p>
						<p>During this apprenticeship, I was tasked with working on various data ingestion projects, utilising my Python expertise. These projects ranged from web-scraping to gathering API meta-data through Apache logs. The opportunity to apply my knowledge in a real-world setting allowed me to gain invaluable experience and further my understanding of how to apply programming concepts to practical tasks.</p>

						<h1>Javascript</h1>

						<p>My experience with JavaScript began when I started exploring web development. I found the language to be incredibly versatile, allowing me to create interactive and dynamic websites with ease. With JavaScript, I have taken part in the maintenance of a business-critical Employee Portal, this personal website, and a few small applications.</p>
						<p>Through my experience with JavaScript, I have learned the importance of clean and organised code, documentation, and testing. I am always looking to expand my knowledge and skills in web development and am excited to see how JavaScript continues to evolve and shape the future of the web.</p>

						<h1>PHP</h1>

						<p>During my time as a Software Developer at Grange Fencing, I had the opportunity to expand my skills even further and delve into PHP. One of my key achievements in this role was creating APIs using PHP's PDO (PHP Data Objects) for data transfer between applications, allowing for a more efficient and streamlined workflow.</p>
						<p>Additionally, I was responsible for managing the backend of our Employee Portal, which was built using PHP. This involved developing and implementing new features, improving the user experience, and ensuring the portal was secure and scalable.</p>
						<p>Working with PHP has been a great experience, and I enjoyed learning about its object-oriented programming capabilities and how it could be leveraged for web development.</p>

						<h4>2021</h4>

					</div>

					<div class="inner-box">

						<h1>Kotlin</h1>

						<p>Kotlin is my go-to language for Android development. I find it more concise, expressive and safe compared to Java. I have developed several Android apps using Kotlin, including a location-based app to aid lorry drivers in their jobs and another business-critical logistics management app.</p>
						<p>In addition to app development, I have also used Kotlin to create API endpoints for Android apps using the Retrofit frameworks. These APIs communicate with a backend database linked to the Employee Portal.</p>

						<h1>HTML and CSS</h1>

						<p>I have extensive experience in creating visually appealing and user-friendly web interfaces using HTML and CSS. Through various projects, I have honed my skills in responsive web design, cross-browser compatibility, and accessibility. I enjoy experimenting with different design patterns and user interaction techniques to create a unique experience for each project.</p>
						<p>I have also used HTML and CSS in conjunction with JavaScript and PHP to create dynamic and interactive web pages. In my role at Grange Fencing, I worked on developing and maintaining an internal Employee Portal that was used by the entire company. I used my HTML and CSS knowledge to create a clean and intuitive interface for users to navigate, while also implementing various back-end functionalities through PHP and JavaScript. Overall, I am confident in my ability to create polished and functional web applications using HTML and CSS.</p>

						<h4>2021</h4>

					<div class="inner-box">

						<h1>MySQL</h1>

						<p>MySQL is a powerful and scalable relational database management system that I have experience working with, in various projects. In my role as a Software Developer, I have utilised MySQL to design, develop and maintain databases for multiple applications.</p>
						<p>In one project, I was tasked with creating a database to store business information for an Android application. I used MySQL to create a normalised schema and implemented efficient indexing to optimise performance. Additionally, I have also used MySQL to design and develop databases for web applications, ensuring that the data was organised and easily accessible.</p>
						<p>In order to manage and manipulate data in MySQL, I am proficient in writing complex queries to efficiently extract information from the database. I have also worked with PHP and PDO (PHP Data Objects) to connect to MySQL databases and manipulate data using SQL queries.</p>
						<p>Overall, my experience with MySQL has allowed me to create efficient and scalable databases for a variety of applications, and I am always eager to continue learning and improving my skills in this area.</p>

						<h4>2021</h4>

					</div>

					<div class="inner-box">

						<h1>Git</h1>

						<p>GitHub is a widely-used platform for version control and source code management. Throughout my career in software development, I have utilised GitHub to manage and collaborate on various projects.</p>
						<p>With GitHub, I have been able to track and manage changes to code in a structured and efficient manner. I have easily created and managed branches, merged code changes, and collaborated with other developers on the same project.</p>
						<p>Whether working on solo projects or with a team, I find GitHub to be an essential tool in my development process. It has allowed me to streamline workflows and manage code changes more effectively, resulting in more efficient and successful projects.</p>
